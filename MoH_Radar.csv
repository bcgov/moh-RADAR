.NET 5,Explore,Platform,TRUE,"<p>We don't call out every new .NET version in the Radar, but <strong>.NET 5</strong> represents a significant step forward in bringing .NET Core and .NET Framework into a single platform. Organizations should start to develop a strategy to migrate their development environments — a fragmented mix of frameworks depending on the deployment target — to a single version of .NET 5 or 6 when it becomes available. The advantage of this approach will be a common development platform regardless of the intended environment: Windows, Linux, cross-platform mobile devices (via <a href=""/radar/tools/xamarin"">Xamarin</a>) or the browser (using <a href=""/radar/languages-and-frameworks/blazor"">Blazor</a>). While polyglot development will remain the preferred approach for companies with the engineering culture to support it, others will find it more efficient to standardize on a single platform for .NET development. For now, we want to keep this in the Assess ring to see how well the final unified framework performs in .NET 6.</p>",y
