Ansible,Employ,Development Tools,TRUE,"<p>Ansible is an open-source software provisioning, configuration management, and application-deployment tool enabling infrastructure as code. IIT uses ansible to automate infrastructure and software installations.</P>",y
Ant,Retire,Development Tools,FALSE,"<p>Apache Ant is a Java library and command-line tool used to drive processes described in build files as targets and extension points dependent upon each other. The main known usage of Ant is the build of Java applications. Ant supplies a number of built-in tasks allowing to compile, assemble, test and run Java applications. Ant was widely used to support build for legacy IIT applications but has been largely replaced by Maven.</p>",y
Angular,Employ,Language,TRUE,<p>Angular is a platform for building mobile and desktop web applications</p>,y
Bit.dev,Explore,Language,TRUE,"<p><strong><a href=""https://bit.dev/"">Bit.dev</a></strong> is a cloud-hosted collaborative platform for UI components extracted, modularized and reused with <a href=""https://github.com/teambit/bit"">Bit</a>. <a href=""/radar/platforms/web-components-standard"">Web components</a> have been around for a while, but building a modern front-end application by assembling small, independent components extracted from other projects has never been easy. Bit was designed to let you do exactly that: extract a component from an existing library or project. You can either build your own service on top of Bit for component collaboration or use Bit.dev.</p>",y
Vue.js,Employ,Language,FALSE,"<p>Vue.js is an open-source JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications. IIT architecture does not promote a single javascipt framework over another and is as a local development project decision. Factors like specific project requirements, integrations with other BC Gov appliacations, and team composition and experience with a given framework will influence and inform choices in selecting a framework.</p>",y
AWS Cloud Watch,Employ,Management,TRUE,<p>Amazon CloudWatch is a metrics repository.</p>,y
Backstage,Explore,Management,FALSE,"<p>We continue to see interest in and use of <strong><a href=""https://backstage.io/"">Backstage</a></strong> grow, alongside the adoption of developer portals, as organizations look to support and streamline their development environments. As the number of tools and technologies increases, some form of standardization is becoming increasingly important for consistency so that developers are able to focus on innovation and product development instead of getting bogged down with reinventing the wheel. Backstage is an open-source developer portal platform created by Spotify, it's based upon software templates, unifying infrastructure tooling and consistent and centralized technical documentation. The plugin architecture allows for extensibility and adaptability into an organization’s infrastructure ecosystem.</p>",y
.NET 5,Explore,Platform,TRUE,"<p>We don't call out every new .NET version in the Radar, but <strong>.NET 5</strong> represents a significant step forward in bringing .NET Core and .NET Framework into a single platform. Organizations should start to develop a strategy to migrate their development environments — a fragmented mix of frameworks depending on the deployment target — to a single version of .NET 5 or 6 when it becomes available. The advantage of this approach will be a common development platform regardless of the intended environment: Windows, Linux, cross-platform mobile devices (via <a href=""/radar/tools/xamarin"">Xamarin</a>) or the browser (using <a href=""/radar/languages-and-frameworks/blazor"">Blazor</a>). While polyglot development will remain the preferred approach for companies with the engineering culture to support it, others will find it more efficient to standardize on a single platform for .NET development. For now, we want to keep this in the Assess ring to see how well the final unified framework performs in .NET 6.</p>",y
.Net Core,Explore,Platform,TRUE,"<p>.NET Core is a free and open-source, managed computer software framework for Windows, Linux, and macOS operating systems. It is a cross-platform successor to.NET Framework.</p>",y
