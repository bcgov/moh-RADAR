Like similar tools, care is still needed to ensure deployments remain easy to understand and maintain. The development kit currently supports <a href=""/radar/languages-and-frameworks/typescript"">TypeScript</a>, JavaScript, Python, Java, C# and .NET. New providers are being added to the CDK core.

Flutter for Web,Explore,Development Tools and Automation,TRUE,"<p>So far, <a href=""/radar/languages-and-frameworks/flutter"">Flutter</a> has primarily supported native iOS and Android applications. However, the Flutter team's vision is to support building applications on every platform. <strong>Flutter for Web</strong> is one step in that direction — it allows us to build apps for iOS, Android and the browser from the same codebase. It has been available for over a year now on the ""Beta"" channel, but with the recent Flutter 2.0 release, Flutter for Web has hit the stable milestone. In the initial release of web support, the Flutter team is focusing on <a href=""https://web.dev/what-are-pwas/"">progressive web apps</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application"">single-page apps</a> and expanding existing mobile apps to the web. The application and framework code (all in <a href=""/radar/languages-and-frameworks/google-dart"">Dart</a>) are compiled to JavaScript instead of ARM machine code, which is used for mobile applications. Flutter’s web engine offers a choice of two renderers: an HTML renderer, which uses HTML, CSS, Canvas and SVG, and a CanvasKit renderer that uses <a href=""/radar/languages-and-frameworks/webassembly"">WebAssembly</a> and WebGL to render Skia paint commands to the browser canvas.

Pulumi,Explore,Development Tools and Automation,FALSE,"<p>We've seen interest in <strong><a href=""https://pulumi.io/"">Pulumi</a></strong> slowly but steadily rising. Pulumi fills a gaping hole in the infrastructure coding world where <a href=""/radar/tools/terraform"">Terraform</a> maintains a firm hold. While Terraform is a tried-and-true standby, its declarative nature suffers from inadequate abstraction facilities and limited testability. Terraform is adequate when the infrastructure is entirely static, but dynamic infrastructure definitions call for a real programming language. Pulumi distinguishes itself by allowing configurations to be written in <a href=""/radar/languages-and-frameworks/typescript"">TypeScript</a>/JavaScript, <a href=""/radar/languages-and-frameworks/python-3"">Python</a> and <a href=""/radar/languages-and-frameworks/go-language"">Go</a> — no markup language or templating required. Pulumi is tightly focused on cloud-native architectures — including containers, serverless functions and data services — and provides good support for <a href=""/radar/platforms/kubernetes"">Kubernetes</a>. Recently, <a href=""/radar/platforms/aws-cloud-development-kit"">AWS CDK</a> has mounted a challenge, but Pulumi remains the only cloud-neutral tool in this area.

The advantage of this approach will be a common development platform regardless of the intended environment: Windows, Linux, cross-platform mobile devices (via <a href=""/radar/tools/xamarin"">Xamarin</a>) or the browser (using <a href=""/radar/languages-and-frameworks/blazor"">Blazor</a>). While polyglot development will remain the preferred approach for companies with the engineering culture to support it, others will find it more efficient to standardize on a single platform for .NET development.

If the need is user-facing, low-latency analytics, SQL-on-Hadoop solutions don't offer the low latency that is needed. Modern OLAP engines like Apache Pinot (or <a href=""https://druid.apache.org/"">Apache Druid</a> and <a href=""https://clickhouse.tech/"">Clickhouse</a> among others) can achieve much lower latency and are particularly suited in contexts where fast analytics, such as aggregations, are needed on immutable data, possibly, with real-time data ingestion. Originally built by LinkedIn, Apache Pinot entered Apache incubation in late 2018 and has since added a plugin architecture and SQL support among other key capabilities.

Kafka,Explore,Platform,TRUE,"<p>As more businesses turn to events as a way to share data among microservices, collect analytics or feed data lakes, <a href=""/radar/tools/apache-kafka"">Apache Kafka</a> has become a favorite platform to support an event-driven architectural style. Although Kafka was a revolutionary concept in scalable persistent messaging, a lot of moving parts are required to make it work, including ZooKeeper, brokers, partitions, and mirrors. While these can be particularly tricky to implement and operate, they do offer great flexibility and power when needed, especially at an industrial enterprise scale. Because of the high barrier to entry presented by the full Kafka ecosystem, we welcome the recent explosion of platforms offering the <strong>Kafka API without Kafka</strong>. Recent entries such as <a href=""https://github.com/streamnative/kop"">Kafka on Pulsar</a> and <a href=""/radar/platforms/redpanda"">Redpanda</a> offer alternative architectures, and <a href=""https://github.com/Azure/azure-event-hubs-for-kafka"">Azure Event Hubs for Kafka</a> provides some compatibility with Kafka producer and consumer APIs. Some features of Kafka, like the streams client library, are not compatible with these alternative brokers, so there are still reasons to choose Kafka over alternative brokers. It remains to be seen, however, if developers actually adopt this strategy or if it is merely an attempt by competitors to lure users away from the Kafka platform. Ultimately, perhaps Kafka's most enduring impact could be the convenient protocol and API provided to clients.</p>",y

Snowflake continues to impress with features like time travel, zero-copy cloning, data sharing and its marketplace. We also haven't found anything we don't like about it, all of which has led to our consultants generally preferring it over the alternatives. Redshift is moving toward storage and compute separation, which has been a strong point of Snowflake, but even with Redshift Spectrum it isn't as convenient and flexible to use, partly because it is bound by its Postgres heritage (we do still like <a href=""/radar/platforms/postgresql-for-nosql"">Postgres</a>, by the way). Federated queries can be a reason to go with Redshift. When it comes to operations, Snowflake is much simpler to run. <a href=""/radar/platforms/bigquery"">BigQuery</a>, which is another alternative, is very easy to operate, but in a multicloud setup Snowflake is a better choice. We can also report that we've used Snowflake successfully with <a href=""/radar/platforms/google-cloud-platform"">GCP</a>, <a href=""/radar/platforms/aws"">AWS</a>, and <a href=""/radar/platforms/azure"">Azure</a>.</p>",n
